# [Game](https://christianalamassi.github.io/Game/)

"Game" includes two easy games to play, user-friendly games for anyone who is looking for a nice pastime without having to concentrate too much, for example when using public transportation or taking a break. The user gets to play against the computer. The games are('tic tac toe') and ('throw the dice'), and the result shows both the player's as well as the computer's. When the game is over, it allows the user to play again which is provided also with the click of one button. The games are programmed with JavaScript and the website is designed with HTML/CSS.

## Features
On the first page of the program is the navigation site and then to the game page. In the following sectors, I will go into details for each site individually.

### Homepage
This section provides an navigation buttons to the games or contact the programmer.

### Game Tic tac toe
- The section will allow the user to play X against the computer O.
- At the top of the page, the user can read the title of the game.
- To win the game, you need to set your "X" in specific patterns which can be in a row, line, column, or curve.
- At the bottom, the user gets the option to click on the "Restart" button or the "Home" button, both of which can be easily identified by the added icons.
- At the end of the game, i.e. the computer or the user wins, it will display the result of the game to tell them that the game is over and whether they have won or lost, then they can choose whether to play again or go back to the home page

### Game Dice
- This section will allow the user to play the "Dice Game".
- On the top of the page the user can read the title of the game.
- Underneath are two pictures, each show two dice. Each picture shows the score of each dice throw, the left one shows the computer's score, the one on the right the user's score (which is zero for both at the start of the game, since none of the players has thrown the dice yet.).
- In between the pictures it shows the score that adds up the score of each round (as in dice throw) for both players. The user will see how many points they got as well as how many points the computer got. Below that there is the "Throw - Dice" button, easily to find for the user.
- In the bottom the user gets the options of clicking the "Restart" button or the "Home" button, both easily to identify with added symbols.
- At the end of the game, meaning either the computer or the user reached 15 points altogether, the user is shown an alert telling them that the game ist over and if they won or lost. The user has to click the "Okay" button on the alert. The screen than shows the result of the game again and the user then gets to choose whether to play again or go back to the homepage.


## Technologies Used
- HTML was used as the foundation of the site.
- CSS was used to add the style and layout of the site.
- JavaScript was used for interaction
- Gitpod was used for the version control of the website.
- GitHub was used to host the code of the website.

## Design
The color blue rgba(6, 37, 132, 0.4) and rgb(7, 64, 234) was used in the background because it is very comfortable for the eyes.

Added the scoring area in the middle, in the middle of the game area to make it easy to follow the scores.

I used a different set of fonts for decoration.

## Accessability
I confirmed that the colors and fonts are clear for the users, by running it through the lighthouse in divtools.



## Testing
I tested my project in three different browsers (Chrome, Edge and Firefox) and the results were satisfying.
Chrome



Edge


FireFox


The game was tested on different screen sizes (laptop screens, desktop screens, tablet screens and phone screens) and I was content with the results here as well.




The game is easy to use and play, the header and "About the game" are easy to understand for the user, even the game itself is very simple to understand.

Unfixed Bugs
In the end of the game, the score area will show you the result after 14 points, instead of 15 points.
The click sound isn't available with volume control but it is not loud. Also it is slower than the click action.
Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages through the following steps:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the main
Once the main has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
